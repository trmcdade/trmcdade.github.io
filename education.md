<!-- ## Education  -->
My undergraduate degrees are in Mathematics (with Honors) and Chinese from the College of William & Mary. I studied Chinese language at Tsinghua University in 2010 and throughout my several years living in China.

At William & Mary, my Mathematics Honors Thesis modeled oyster repopulation efforts in the Chesapeake Bay. My Chinese senior thesis analyzed the relationship between Chinese state-owned enterprises and the central government. I studied Chinese Language and Literature at Tsinghua University in the summer of 2010.
