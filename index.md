I am a political economist focusing on the relationship between economic markets and government policy. My research pays particular attention to financial instruments, international financial flows, and household economics, and my professional experience spans the financial, tech, and academic sectors.

<!-- I hold a PhD from Duke University and undergraduate degrees from the College of William and Mary in Math and Chinese. -->

The main focuses of my research are currently (1) the economic and financial consequences of demographics, (2) the national, social, and behavioral constraints on household savings behavior, and (3) the mitigation of longevity risk. Insights extracted from my research inform investment theses and product ideas.

In addition to my time in academia, I worked for Microsoft, where I was the data scientist responsible for Microsoft Azure’s China analytics, based in Beijing. My work informed company financials and earnings reports as well as business decisions on data center capacity, marketing campaigns, supply chains, and customer acquisition.

I hold a PhD in Political Economy from Duke University with expertise in household economics, financial markets, transnational investment, foreign policy, and quantitative methods. I also hold a BS with Honors from the College of William & Mary in Math and Chinese; I studied Chinese Language & Literature at Tsinghua University. I am a term member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
