I am a political economist with a PhD from Duke University's department of Political Science. My research focuses on economic constraints on government with particular attention to financial markets, international financial flows, and household economics. Before Duke, I worked for Microsoft in Seattle and Beijing. My undergraduate degrees are in Math and Chinese.
