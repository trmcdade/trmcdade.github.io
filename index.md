I am a political economist focusing on economic constraints on government with particular attention to financial markets, international financial flows, and household economics. Before Duke, I worked for Microsoft in Seattle and Beijing. I hold a PhD from Duke University and undergraduate degrees from the College of William and Mary in Math and Chinese.
