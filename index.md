I am a PhD Candidate in Duke University's department of Political Science studying political economy. My research focuses on economic constraints on government with particular attention to financial markets and household economics. I expect to graduate in May 2022. Before I came to Duke, I worked for Microsoft in Seattle and Beijing. My undergraduate degrees are in Math and Chinese.
