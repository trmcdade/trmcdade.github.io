I am a political economist focusing on the relationship between economic markets and government policy. My research pays particular attention to financial instruments, international financial flows, and household economics, and my professional experience spans the financial, tech, and academic sectors. I hold a PhD from Duke University and undergraduate degrees from the College of William and Mary in Math and Chinese.
