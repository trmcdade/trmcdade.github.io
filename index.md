### Welcome to GitHub Pages

Welcome! I am a computational political economist. I am currently a PhD student in Duke University's department of Political Science. My research employs quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze

the connection between government financing, household economics, and political participation. I also study the relationship between international organizations and countries’ decision-making processes during conflicts.
