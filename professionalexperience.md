<!-- ## Professional Experience -->
Prior to arriving at Duke, I worked for Microsoft Azure in Seattle and Beijing. I was in charge of constructing the internal analytics for Microsoft Azure China. My reports informed company financials and earnings reports, as well as internal decisions on datacenter capacity, marketing campaigns, and supply chain improvements.
